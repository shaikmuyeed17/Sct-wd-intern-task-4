#✅ To-Do Web Application
This project is part of my internship at Skill Craft Technology. It is a simple and interactive To-Do Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The app allows users to manage daily tasks efficiently by adding, editing, organizing, and marking them as completed. It also supports date & time settings to help with task scheduling and productivity.
